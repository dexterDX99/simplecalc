This calculation seems a bit off or at least inconsistent in the way it's reported. Let's break it down together and verify each key part to determine if the **final profit of Rs. 202,000** is actually accurate.

---

### üßÆ **Step-by-step Breakdown**

#### 1. **Buying Summary**
- **Total Buying Price**: Rs. 1,250,000  
- **Per Tola Price (as per user)**: Rs. 250,000  
- So:  
  \> **Number of tolas bought =** Rs. 1,250,000 / 250,000 = **5 tola**

---

#### 2. **Gold Specs**
- **Market Gold Price (24K)**: Rs. 320,000 / tola  
- **Selected Jewelry Purity**: 22K  
- 22K = 91.67% of 24K  
  \> So, **Gold Price Per Tola (22K) = 320,000 √ó 91.67% ‚âà Rs. 293,334**

Looks accurate.

---

#### 3. **Gold Weight Conversion**
- 1 tola = 11.664 grams  
- 5 tola = **5 √ó 11.664 = 58.32 grams** ‚úÖ (Matches your value)

---

#### 4. **Wastage Deduction**
- Jeweler deducts **5 grams**  
  - 5g of 22K gold = (293,333.33 / 11.664) √ó 5 ‚âà **Rs. 125,743.03** ‚úÖ

So, **Loss due to Wastage: Rs. 125,743.03** ‚úÖ

---

#### 5. **Loss Due to Lower Purity**
- Full 5 tola at 24K = Rs. 320,000 √ó 5 = Rs. 1,600,000  
- At 22K = Rs. 293,333.33 √ó 5 = Rs. 1,466,667  
- **Difference = Rs. 133,333**, not **259,076.36** ‚ùå

So this number seems wrong. **Your loss due to lower purity should be Rs. 133,333.33**, not over Rs. 259k.

---

#### 6. **Price Paid Above Market**
- Your cost per tola = Rs. 250,000  
- 22K gold market price = Rs. 293,333.33  
- You're **buying below** market value ‚Äî so you‚Äôve saved **Rs. 43,333.33 per tola √ó 5 = Rs. 216,667**

So you technically made a **"Market Value Savings" profit** of Rs. 216,667 ‚Äî not **Rs. 0**.

---

#### 7. **Final Total Value**
- Actual gold value at 22K = Rs. 1,466,666.67 ‚úÖ  
- You paid Rs. 1,250,000 ‚úÖ  
- So total gain = Rs. **216,667**  
- But since you lost **Rs. 125,743** to wastage, your **net profit = Rs. 90,924**

### ‚úÖ **Corrected Value Summary**

| Metric                              | Value            |
|-------------------------------------|------------------|
| Market Gold Price (22K)             | Rs. 293,333.33   |
| Total Gold Weight                   | 58.32g (5 tola)  |
| Total Market Value                  | Rs. 1,466,667    |

| Wastage Value (5g)                  | Rs. 125,743      |
| Price Paid Above Market             | Rs. **-216,667** (i.e., savings) |
| **Net Profit**                      | Rs. **90,924**   |

### üßæ Conclusion:
- ‚ùå The values listed in your original breakdown are **not fully accurate**.
- ‚úÖ Your **actual profit is around Rs. 90,924**, **not Rs. 202,000**.
- Also, the "Loss Due to Lower Purity" figure seems **incorrectly inflated**.
